# ArduinoDevelopment
Repository for collecting documentation about Arduino and Arduino Development.

#### Visual Studio Code with Arduino:
[Click here](https://github.com/DJFro/ArduinoDevelopment/blob/master/Development_Envrionment/arduino_with_visualstudiocode.md) for information about how to setup __Visual Studio Code__ for __Arduino development__. Visual Studio Code is a great code editor, and gives you __intellisense__ in your arduino sketches. If you are not familiar with intellisense you could describe it as a sort of _autocomplete_ for code, but it offers more than that, [read about it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense). 

#### Arduino Development tips:
[Click here](https://github.com/DJFro/ArduinoDevelopment/blob/master/Development/arduino_development_tips.md) for tips about how setup your arduino solutions and how to write efficient code. This is a work-in-progress.
